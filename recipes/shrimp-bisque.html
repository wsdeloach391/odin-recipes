        <dt><h2>Description</h2></dt>
        <dd><p>As Cupid prances in, carrying his trusty bow and quiver of arrows, food talk inevitably turns to oysters, chocolate, and other well-known aphrodisiacs. But the luscious, creamy seafood known as "shrimp bisque" is the true arrowhead that many seafood fans are struck by.</p>

        <p>Traditionally, bisques are made with a good deal of butter and cream, which helps to achieve the silky texture. However, this recipe is lightened up by replacing butter with heart-healthy olive oil and a reduced amount of cream. But make no mistake, this bisque's texture is as creamy as they come. The shrimp stock, flavored with dry sherry, blends beautifully with the shrimp and a mirepoix (onions, carrots, and celery) to make a soup that is worthy of aphrodisiac status.</p></dd>

                <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saucepan set over moderately high heat. Add shrimp shells and cook, stirring frequently, until the tails turn pink, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add sherry and cook, stirring frequently, until most of sherry is evaporated. Add water and bay leaf, bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Let the mixture simmer, uncovered for 20 minutes. Pour shrimp stock through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Press gently on the shrimp shells to release extra liquid. Discard shells and bay leaf.</li>
                <li>While stock is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saucepan set over medium heat. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring frequently, until the shrimp are just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a bowl and set aside. To the saucepan, add 1 tablespoon olive and carrots, celery, and onion.</li>
                <li>Cook until the onion and celery are soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in shrimp stock, rice, tomato paste, cayenne pepper, and salt. Cover the saucepan and simmer the mixture until the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Reserve 8 shrimp and stir the remaining shrimp into the soup. Allow the mixture to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Using an immersion blender or a regular blender (in 2 to 3 batches), puree the soup until smooth. Take care not to burn yourself. Return the soup to the saucepan and stir in cream. Reheat on low.</li>
